This document contains information for those who are transferring the SRGP
source code from a UNIX system to a Mac.

For information on installing and using SRGP on the Macintosh, consult the file
called "MacSRGP_README" (also found in this directory).

==============================================================================

		INFORMATION FOR THOSE COPYING FROM UNIX TO MAC

The files which should be transferred to a Mac in order to create the Mac
version of SRGP lie in two directories:
	1) src/srgp
	2) examples

In each of those two directories, you'll find a file called
"__mactransfer_filelist", naming all the files in that directory that should be
sent to the Mac.  This file will help you automate the transfer if you know
some basic UNIX/shell tricks.  For instance, if you will use ftp to do the
transfer, you can use the following sed command to create a file containing a
"put" command for each file:

	sed 's/^/put /' __mactransfer_filelist  > /tmp/putcmds
	
The resulting file may be fed straight into ftp's stdin, being prepended with a
carriage return (so the first "put" won't be ignored) and appended with a
"quit". 

The file containing SRGP's resources (SRGPproject.rsrc.hqx) is in hex format
and (as soon as you've gotten it onto a Mac) it must be converted to binary via
the BinHex program, or the StuffIt program, or any equivalent supporting BinHex
format.

Now...  on the Macintosh...

Make a folder called "SRGP/SPHIGS Root".  In it, place the resources file. 
You will create project files in here later.

In the new "root" folder, make a folder called "MacSRGP".  It should contain
the ".c" and ".h" files found in the "src/srgp/" directory.

In the new "MacSRGP" folder, make a folder called "Applications".  In it should
be all files transferred from the "examples/" directory.
