		INFORMATION FOR THOSE COPYING FROM UNIX TO MAC

The files which should be transferred to a Mac in order to create the Mac
version of SPHIGS lie in three directories:
	1) src/sphigs
	2) examples
	2) examples/viewing_demo.MAConly

In each of those directories, you'll find a file called
"__mactransfer_filelist", naming all the files in that directory that should be
sent to the Mac.  This file will help you automate the transfer if you know
some basic UNIX/shell tricks.  For instance, if you will use ftp to do the
transfer, you can use the following sed command to create a file containing a
"put" command for each file:

	sed 's/^/put /' __mactransfer_filelist  > /tmp/putcmds
	
The resulting file may be fed straight into ftp's stdin, being prepended with a
carriage return (so the first "put" won't be ignored) and appended with a
"quit". 

The file containing SPHIGS's resources (SPHIGSproject.rsrc.hqx) is in hex
format and (as soon as you've gotten it onto a Mac) it must be converted to
binary via the BinHex program, or the StuffIt program, or any equivalent
supporting BinHex format.

Now...  on the Macintosh...

Make a folder called "MacSPHIGS".  It should contain the header and source
files transferred from src/sphigs.  The resource file should go in the root
folder (see the MacSRGP_README file).

In the MacSPHIGS folder, make a folder called "Applications".  In it should be
all files transferred from the examples directories.
