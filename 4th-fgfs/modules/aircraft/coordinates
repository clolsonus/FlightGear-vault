Q: What is ACM's coordinate system like? What basic units are used? 

It looks like the Right-Hand-Rule is used exclusively, but thumbs-down
instead of thumbs-up, like so:

      First finger: the positive X-axis is away from you (North) 

      2nd finger: the positive Y-axis is to the right (East) 

      Thumb: the positive Z-axis is down (negative is Up) 

All distances are in feet. Angles are in radians. Velocity is in
feet-per-second.  Yaw/pitch/roll rates are in radians per
second. Conversions are made to the usual units when displayed on the
HUD.
